For useful tasks like traffic density estimation on a particular road stretch, it is 
important to first correct the camera angle in software, and crop the image to remove 
the additional objects. This is the goal of the first assignment Subtask1.

Our folder contains t.cpp , Makefile and Readme File.

Approach (In t.cpp)
change color of original image to grey-scale
selected 4 points manually using mouse click using click function
this points are the source point
destination points are the same as used by ma'am
In our code, we have first used concept of homography to convert the original frame
homography will make a matrix h which will be used to make the projected frame
we have then used wrapPerspectiveTransform to change original frame to projected frame
then we have made a matrix to store the cropped image using getPerspectiveTransform
stroing cropped matrix in crop and projected image in imout
thereby saving the cropped and projected images in the same directory as our sourse code.

For Makefile 
It contains library flags 
target is my source code file t with dependency t.cpp
then command that generates the target and executable file i.e. mycode

For running on terminal
First compile the program using the command  make
then for running
./mycode image_name
if the image is present in the directory, it will show the given image. Left click on 4 points of which you want to get the bird view.
 Press any key to get the projected image. Again press any any key to get the cropped image.
 If the name of the image entered does not exist in the directory, it will show "image is not present" and the program ends.
