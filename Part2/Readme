This is the subtask 2 of assignment 1
In this part we have to calculate Queue density and Dynamic density of Traffic in road going northwards
Our code contains two parts 
1) Queue density calculation using Background Subtraction method
2) Dynamic density calculation using Optical Flow method

We are running our video in 3 fps 

# Queue density
Initially we are taking input of empty image which contains no empty road for the queue density
extracting frames from video one at a time
converting the frame and the empty image into grayscale image as this will give us clear binary images
Now using absdiff function of openCV for calculating Background Subtraction and storing in an image
This image will contain noise in it , so to eliminate it use Gaussian blur function
Now to get the resultant image in binary we use threshold function which gives black and white image.
We only want the north going road for our calculation of queue density
so using the function of subtask 1 of cropping the image for desired region.
After this calculate the white pixels of image using countNonZero of openCV 
also calculate the total pixels of cropped image 
white pixels will give the moving as well as stationary objects appearing in road

Queue density = No of white pixels / No of total pixels

# Dynamic density
It consists of using the Optical Flow concept
Here take two frames at a time and convert to grayscale
Now use the function calcOpticalFlow which gives the image of moving objects.
This image will be converted to BRG and then to grayscale as it was HSV earlier.
This grayscale image will contains noise 
hence use Gaussian blur and then threshold function to get binary images
Now crop as earlier and get the resultant image 
Do the same as calculating white pixels and total pixels of cropped image
Here white pixels will give moving objects in road

Dynamic density = No of white pixels / No of total pixels

This process will continue till the last empty frame is encounted .i.e video ends.

The terminal will contain the desired tab seperated columns of time, queue density, Dynamic density

### output file  
The sample output file will contain the time , queue density, Dynamic density
From this we make a curve 
It is clear from curve that as the vehicles approach signal and it is RED, queue density increases
and becomes attain saturation.
The dynamic density increases and will start to reduce as vehicles stop at signal RED
Now after signal turns GREEN dynamic density starts to increase and queue density decrease as vehicles 
leave the traffic region.
Queue density >= Dynamic density
